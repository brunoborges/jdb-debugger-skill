You are investigating Java applications that users have reported contain multiple bugs.

## Context
- The compiled applications are in the `classes/` directory.
- There are two main classes to test:
  1. `com.example.WarningAppTest` — run with: `java -cp classes com.example.WarningAppTest`
  2. `com.example.ConsoleAppTest` — run with: `java -cp classes com.example.ConsoleAppTest "PREMIUM "` (note the trailing space in the argument)
- You do NOT have access to the source code. 
- Compile commands are not needed.
- Do NOT use `javap` or any bytecode disassembly tools to inspect the classes. You MUST debug the application to investigate runtime behavior.

## Your Task
1. Run each application first to observe its behavior.
2. For each bug found, determine the root cause by inspecting variables and stepping through code.
3. Write a file called `DEBUG-REPORT.md` in the current directory with your findings.

## DEBUG-REPORT.md Format
The report MUST include a section for each bug found with:
- A short title describing the bug
- The exception type or symptom observed
- The method and line where it occurs
- The root cause explanation
- Suggested fix

Find ALL bugs in both applications. There are multiple bugs to discover.
