You are investigating Java applications that users have reported contain multiple bugs.

## Context
- The compiled applications are in the `classes/` directory.
- Test all of the following classes (default package):
  1. `WarningAppTest` — run with: `java -cp classes WarningAppTest`
  2. `ConsoleAppTest` — run with: `java -cp classes ConsoleAppTest "PREMIUM\t"`
  3. `AliasingCorruptionTest` — run with: `java -cp classes AliasingCorruptionTest`
  4. `ClassLoaderConflictTest` — run with: `java -cp classes ClassLoaderConflictTest`
  5. `ThreadTest` — run with: `java -cp classes ThreadTest`
  6. `VisibilityTest` — run with: `java -cp classes VisibilityTest`
- You do NOT have access to the source code. 
- Compile commands are not needed.
- Do NOT use `javap` or any bytecode disassembly tools to inspect the classes. You MUST debug the application to investigate runtime behavior.

## Your Task
1. Run each application first to observe its behavior.
2. For each bug found, determine the root cause by inspecting variables and stepping through code.
3. Include both exception-based bugs and runtime-behavior bugs.
4. Write a file called `DEBUG-REPORT.md` in the current directory with your findings.

## DEBUG-REPORT.md Format
The report MUST include a section for each bug found with:
- A short title describing the bug
- The exception type or symptom observed
- The method and line where it occurs
- The root cause explanation
- Suggested fix

Find ALL bugs across all listed applications. There are multiple bugs to discover.
